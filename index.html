                and Wizardry, during which a series of messages on the walls of the school's corridors warn that the "Chamber
                of Secrets" has been opened and that the "heir of Slytherin" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical
                families. These threats are found after attacks which leave residents of the school "petrified" (frozen like
                stone). Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione investigate the attacks.
